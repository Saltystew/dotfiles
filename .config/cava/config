## Configuration file for CAVA. Default values are commented out.  Use either ; or # for commenting.


[general]

# smoothing mode, can be normal, scientific or waves.
  mode = normal
 
# Framerate Default: 60. Accepts only non-negative values.
  framerate = 144

# Sensitivity in  %. If you think the bars are to low/response is to little, try
# increasing this value 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.
  sensitivity = 10

# Autosens will attempt to decrease sensitivity if cava peaks. 1 = on, 0 = off
  autosens = 0

# The number of bars. 0 (default) sets it to auto (fill up console).
# width of bars and space between bars in number of characters. Default width 3 and space 1.
; bars = 0 
  bar_width = 1
  bar_spacing = 1


# Lower and higher cutoff frequencies for lowest and highest bars
# the bandwith of the visualizer, defaults to 50 - 10000 Hz
# Note: there is a minimum total bandwith of 43Mhz x number of bars. 
# Cava will automatically increase the higher cuttoff if a too low band is specified.
  lower_cutoff_freq = 50 
#  higher_cutoff_freq = 1000 



[input]

# method of capturing audio, possible methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo'.
# Defaults to 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source' 
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# for pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them)
# 
# for alsa 'source' will be the capture device. Default: 'hw:Loopback,1'
# for fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file. Default: '/tmp/mpd.fifo' 
; method = pulse
; source = auto

; method = alsa  
; source = hw:Loopback,1 

; method = fifo
; source = /tmp/mpd.fifo



[output]

# method used to draw output may be ncurses, noncurses.
  method = ncurses

# visual styles, may be 'stereo' or 'mono'. 
# Stereo mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# Mono averages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies
  style = Stereo 

# Raw output target. A fifo will be created if target does not exist.
; raw_target = /dev/stdout

# Raw data format. Can be 'binary' or 'ascii'.
; data_format = binary

# Binary bit format, can be '8bit' (0-255) or '16bit' (0-65530).
; bit_format = 16bit

# Ascii max value. In 'ascii' mode range will run from 0 to value specified here
; ascii_max_range = 1000

# Ascii delimiters. In ascii format each bar and frame is separated by a delimiters.
# Use decimal value in ascii table (i.e. 59 = ';' and 10 = '\n' (line feed)).
; bar_delimiter = 59
; frame_delimiter = 10


[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires a
# terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.
  background = '#262626'
  foreground = '#5fafaf'

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported, background must also be defined in hex
# or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off. Warning: for certain terminal emulators cava will
# not able to restore color definitions on exit, simply restart your terminal to restore colors.

[smoothing]

# Percentage value for integral smoothing. Takes values from 0 - 100.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
 integral = 25

# Disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing" with or without "waves". Set to 0 to disable. 
 monstercat = 1
 waves = 0

# Set gravity percentage for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
# Accepts only non-negative values. 50 means half gravity, 200 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
 gravity = 135


# In bar height, bars that would have been lower that this will not be drawn.
; ignore = 0

[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want. 
# remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
 1 = 10 # bass
 2 = 7.5
 3 = 7.5 # midtone
 4 = 7.5
 5 = 10 # treble
